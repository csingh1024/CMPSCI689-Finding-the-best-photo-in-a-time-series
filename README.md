Our proposed model involves a siamese neural network architecture which uses a ranking loss function to rank two similar images based on the aesthetic quality. We experimented with two architecture for each siamese network, VGG19 and Inception v3. The model achieved an accuracy of 71 % on the test data. 
 
+ Used Pytorch.
